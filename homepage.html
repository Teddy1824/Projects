        Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a
        computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set
        of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what
        to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to
        make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.
